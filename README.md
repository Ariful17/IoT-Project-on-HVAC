# IoT-Project-on-HVAC
This project is associated with HVAC or heating, ventialtion and air-conditioning of a closed area. Temperature, relative humidity and pressure- these three parameters are monitored with an upper and lower threshold values. If the threshold is passed, warning will be displayed on the dashboard in real time.
Also necessary actions will also be taken to bring back the conditions within desired limits. Humidifying or dehumidifying, heating or cooling and pressurizing or depressurizing will be done depending on the situation. Components used-
- esp8266
- DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor
- BMP280 pressure sensor
- solid state relays and buck module
